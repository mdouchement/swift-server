# Swift-server

[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/mdouchement/swift-server.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/mdouchement/swift-server)

**Only for development and test purpose.**

Swift-server is a Sinatra server that responds to the same calls Openstack Swift responds to. It's a convenient way to use Swift out-of-the-box without any fancy dependencies and configuration.

Swift-server doesn't support all of the Swift command set, but the basic ones like upload, download, list, copy, authentication, and make containers are supported. More coming soonâ„¢. See file [app.rb](https://github.com/mdouchement/swift-server/blob/master/app.rb) for supported commands.
